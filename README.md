The main experiments are test_usps.py and test_iris.py
Plotting is done in the plotting.ipynb file.

There is some junk in here that will be cleaned up later but those 3 files are your 
primary scripts. 

the neural networks are defined in MLPClassifier.py and CNNClassifier.py, however 
these still get parameterized in the script files.

Data loading tools are defined in Data.py
